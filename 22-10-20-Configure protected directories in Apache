xFusionCorp Industries has hosted several static websites on Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos DC. There are some confidential directories on document root that need to be password protected. Because they are using Apache for hosting the websites, the production support team has decided to use .htaccess with basic auth. There is a website that needs to be uploaded to /var/www/html/dba on Nautilus App Server 3. However, we need to set up the authentication before that.

a. Create /var/www/html/dba direcotry if doesn't exist.

b. Add a user javed in htpasswd and set its password to B4zNgHA7Ya.

c. There is a file /tmp/index.html placed on Jump Server. Copy the same to new directory you created, please make sure default document root should remain /var/www/html. Also website should work on URL http://<app-server-hostname>:<port>/dba

Solution:

Login to server

ssh banner@stapp03  

Add a user and set password

sudo htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd james

Restart

sudo systemctl restart httpd


Create mentioned Directory

mkdir /var/www/html/dba

Go to sysops directory and create .htaccess file

sudo vi .htaccess

Give this configuration

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Password Required"
Require valid-user
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd


Now go to jump server and copy index file

 scp /tmp/index.html banner@stapp03:/tmp

Again copy from tmp folder to mentioned directory

cp /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/dba

Check by typing this curl command

curl -u james http://127.0.0.1:8080/dba/index.html
