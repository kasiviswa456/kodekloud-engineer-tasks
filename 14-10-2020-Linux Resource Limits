On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:

a. soft limit = 80

b. hard_limit = 92

Solution:

vi /etc/security/limits.conf

Type i for insert mode in editor and add the following lines

nfsuser soft nproc 80
nfsuser hard nproc 92

Finally check the limits by typing this command

cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#
