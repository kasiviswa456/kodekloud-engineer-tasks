The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named epel_local and make sure to set Repository ID to epel_local. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repo.


Solution:

[root@stbkp01 ~]# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum.repo
[epel_local]
name=epel_local
baseURL=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

yum clean all

yum repolist

yum install vim-enhanced -y
