xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in -progress, but we want to get the servers ready. The storage server has a shared directory /data that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd package and dependencies on all app hosts.

b. Apache should serve on port 8080 within the apps.

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/news and /home/thor/cluster on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that news should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/news/ and cluster should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/cluster. (do not worry about load balancer configuration, as its already configured).

d. You can access the website on LBR link; to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select the option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.

Solution:

This worked for me:

On all App server,

yum install httpd -y

yum install openssh-clients -y

systemctl restart sshd

From JumpHost,

scp -r /home/thor/news tony@stapp01:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/cluster tony@stapp01:/tmp

scp -r /home/thor/news steve@stapp02:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/cluster steve@stapp02:/tmp

scp -r /home/thor/news banner@stapp03:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/cluster banner@stapp03:/tmp

from any one of appserver move the folder on the correct location

mv /tmp/news /var/www/html
mv /tmp/cluster /var/www/html

Again from all APP server,

change the Listen 8080 at vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

Validate the solution from Jumphost,

curl http://stapp01:8080/news
curl http://stapp01:8080/cluster

curl http://stapp02:8080/news
curl http://stapp02:8080/cluster

curl http://stapp03:8080/news
curl http://stapp03:8080/cluster
