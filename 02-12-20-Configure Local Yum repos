The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named localyum and make sure to set Repository ID to localyum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package httpd from this newly created repo.

Solution:

Below steps worked to me.

cd /etc/yum.repos.d
vi localyum.repo

[localyum]
name=localyum
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled = 1
gpgcheck = 0

yum clean all
yum repolist
yum install --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=“localyum” httpd
