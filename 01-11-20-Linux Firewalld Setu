To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx services running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Apache. We might have more robust firewall settings in the future, but for now we have decided to go with the given requirements listed below:

a. Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port.

b. Allow incoming connections from LB host only on Apache port and block for all others.

c. All rules must be permanent.

d. Zone should be public.

e. If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already, please make sure to start them.

Solution:

I followed the below steps referring to your earlier post.

#To check the status of nginx and httpd
systemctl status nginx && systemctl status httpd

#To check the port number for nginx and httpd
grep -i Listen /etc/httpd/conf/ht* /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

#install firewall & start and check status
yum install firewalld -y
systemctl start firewalld && systemctl enable firewalld && systemctl status firewalld

find nginx port 8096
yum install net-tools
netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
systemctl restart dbus

systemctl start firewalld && systemctl enable firewalld && systemctl status firewalld

#adding firewall rules to allow and block

firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8097/tcp(nginx port) --permanent
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service={http,https}
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=172.16.238.14 port port=8082(apache port) protocol=tcp accept'
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --change-interface=wan

firewall-cmd --reload
firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
systemctl restart firewalld && systemctl status firewalld
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports && firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all && firewall-cmd --list-all

Also, modified the nginx config file

server {
server_name 172.16.238.10;
root /usr/share/nginx/html;
}

proxy_pass http://172.16.238.10:8082/;

systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status httpd

telnet stapp01 8097

telnet stapp02 8097

telnet stapp03 8097

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=172.16.238.14 port port=5003 protocol=tcp accept'
