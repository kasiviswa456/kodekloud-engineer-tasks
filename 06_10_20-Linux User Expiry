A developer Kareem has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for Kareem. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named kareem on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to 2021-01-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

Solution:

App server1: 
tony@172.16.238.10
pwd: Ir0nM@n


useradd -e 2021-01-28 kareem

change -l kareem (To see the user details list expire dates)
