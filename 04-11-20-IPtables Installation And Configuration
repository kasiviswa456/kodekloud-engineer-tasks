We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 5000 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

Block incoming port 5000 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

Solution:

sudo yum install iptables-services -y

systemctl start iptables && systemctl enable iptables && systemctl status iptables

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8081 -j DROP
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8081 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT

service iptables save

iptables -L -n

Make sure you add the iptables command without -A option. Append will add your rules at the bottom of the tables which will not have any affect because one above this rule is block all connections. Thats why your LB is still not reachable.

Just add -I (Insert option which will add at the top), you can verify the rules order by iptables -L Also make sure to test it from LB host and Jump host to validate the answer.

Sathish is correct. Try to add these lines one by one "iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 3001 -j DROP" and then add these line "iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8082 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT" and to save rules permanently type "service iptables save"
