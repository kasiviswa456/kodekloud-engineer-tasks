We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 5000 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

Block incoming port 5000 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

Solution:

sudo  yum install iptables-services -y

systemctl start iptables && systemctl enable iptables && systemctl status iptables

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8082 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8082 -j DROP

sudo iptables-save

curl stapp01:8082
talenet stapp01 5000


sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8082 -j DROP 
sudo iptables -A public -s 172.16.238.14 -p tcp --dport 8082 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A public -p tcp --destination-port 8082 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT
