The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App 2 in Stratos Datacenter.
Create a user named mariyam in App Server 2 without a home directory.

Solution: 
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false USERNAME
