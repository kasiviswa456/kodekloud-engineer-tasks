For our infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter, we need to serve our website code from a common/shared location that can be shared among all app nodes. To solve this, we came up with a solution to use the NFS (Network File System) server where we can store the data and mount the share among our app nodes. The dedicated NFS server will be our storage server. To accomplish this task, perform the following steps:

Install required NFS packages on storage server.

Configure storage server to act as an NFS server.

Make a NFS share /data on storage server.

Install and configure NFS client packages on all app nodes and configure them to act as NFS client.

Mount /data directory on all app nodes at /var/www/appdata directory (Create the directories if don't exist).

Start and enable required services.

There is an /tmp/index.html file on jump host. Copy this file on NFS server (storage server) under /data and make sure it gets replicated to all app servers in mounted location.


 
 Solution:
 
 1.## Setting Up the NFS Server

yum install -y nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib
vi /etc/exports
 
/data 172.16.238.10(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/data 172.16.238.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/data 172.16.238.12(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

systemctl enable nfs-server && sudo systemctl start nfs-server && sudo systemctl status nfs-server

2.## Setting Up the NFS Client in all apps server

yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib

mkdir -p /var/www/appdata && sudo mount -t nfs 172.16.238.15:/data /var/www/appdata

to add permanent
vi /etc/fstab

echo 172.16.238.15:/data /var/www/appdata nfs defaults 0 0 > /etc/fstab

systemctl enable nfs-server && sudo systemctl restart nfs-server && sudo systemctl status nfs-server

copy from jump server
scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/tmp

to use scp we have to install open-ssh in storage server also, then scp from jump server it will work.
sudo yum install -y openssh-clients openssh
