The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:
a. Install tomcat server on App Server 1 using yum.

b. Configure it to run on port 8089.

c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp. Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e without specifying any sub-directory anything like this http://URL/ROOT .

d. You can access the website on LBR link. To do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.

Solution:

I have completed below steps and its worked.

Copy from jump host to server

scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@stapp03:/tmp

sudo yum install tomcat

Move war file to webapps directory after install

cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps

Edit file : change port in below part

vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml
