Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 6300 (which is our Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.

Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.

Solution:

At first Login to stapp01 server or the server that has issue

ssh tony@stapp01

Login as root: sudo su

Then check httpd 

systemctl status httpd

If the status is inactive then find the error by typing

httpd -t

Then go to httpd.conf by typing vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Uncomment ServerName

ServerName 172.16.238.10:3004

Save it by :wq!

Next check which service is blocking your port by typing this command

netstat -anp |grep LISTEN |grep ":3004"

Kill the process 

kill -9 pid_number

Then restart httpd

systemctl restart httpd

systemctl status httpd

Next add rules to the iptable


iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 6300 -j ACCEPT
iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables

From the Host

curl http://172.16.238.10:6300
